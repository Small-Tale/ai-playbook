## Ticket-Driven Work

The Hot Sheet workflow owns ticket creation, claims, phases and ETAs, releasing, follow-ups, the `FEEDBACK NEEDED` rule, and the completion checklist (HS2-B39GQ9). This rule adds what the workflow does not say.

- A claim is the live activity signal; `claim_count` records past attempts and must not be used to infer current activity.
- Before asking for feedback, check open tickets and the code. Status reports, release waits, and sandbox blockers are regular notes, not feedback requests; close tickets you created yourself; give a visual tradeoff captures and `CHOICE` options.
- Re-read the whole ticket, including notes added since your last read, before every action on it, and quote the note you are acting on in your result.
- Change only what the ticket asks and preserve neighboring appearance and behavior; propose collateral changes as separate tickets. When the ticket names an attachment, reference art, a prior implementation, or another project, open it before designing.
- Measure before restructuring: record the number that justifies a performance or architecture change, and close the ticket as not worth it when the number is small.
- Record `activity` notes when a meaningful subtask starts and finishes; keep repeated or reversed transitions as separate history entries. Put conclusions, decisions, and recommendations in `regular` Markdown notes, with a short activity entry pointing to them when useful.
- Give each AI-authored activity note a one-line, outcome-oriented `note_summary` in the same update as its Markdown body. Keep the summary plain text and preferably under 80 characters; put implementation and verification detail in the body.
- For multiline CLI Markdown, use `--note-file <path>` (or `--note-file -` for stdin) with real line breaks. Use `--allow-literal-backslash-n` only when literal backslash-n prose is intentional.
